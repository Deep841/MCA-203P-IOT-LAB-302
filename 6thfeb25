Big Data Lab Notes

Weekly Task Submission
	•	Deadline: 12-1 PM

Dataset Creation
	•	The simplest way to create a dataset is using an Excel Sheet (.xls).

Graphs and Their Utility
	•	Bar Graph: Shows peaks and depths, useful for analyzing patterns like temperature and student marks when data is fixed.
	•	Line Chart: Suitable for comparing marks of two classes.
	•	Scatter Diagram: Used to check data distribution.
	•	No Clustering: Clusters may introduce bias in data.
	•	Feature Selection: Essential for refining data analysis.

Regression Analysis
	•	Regression Line: Helps analyze bias in data after observing the dataset.

Box Plot (Box Graph) Insights
	•	Mean, Median, and Mode can be determined.
	•	Minimum Value: Represented by the lower line.
	•	Maximum Value: Represented by the upper line.
	•	Rectangular Area: Indicates where most of the data lies.
	•	Thick Line in the Rectangle: Represents the median, which may be at the center, above, or below.
	•	If the thick line is above the center, most of the data lies in the lower part.
	•	Box Plot Application: Useful for analyzing students’ marks distribution.

 Scatter Graph for Prediction

A scatter graph is used for prediction by identifying trends and relationships between two numerical variables.
	•	It helps in finding correlations between independent and dependent variables.
	•	If the points form a clear upward or downward trend, it indicates a positive or negative correlation.
	•	No correlation: If points are scattered randomly, it means no relationship exists.
	•	Trendline (Best-Fit Line): Can be added to make future predictions based on existing data.
	•	Application: Used in predicting house prices based on area, stock market trends, weather forecasting, and student performance trends.

 If-Else Condition in R (RStudio)
 example : 
 marks <- 75

if (marks >= 50) {
  print("Passed")
} else {
  print("Failed")
}

For Loop in R (RStudio)
example : 

# Print numbers from 1 to 5
for (i in 1:5) {
  print(i)
}
